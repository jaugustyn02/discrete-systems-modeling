Implemented improvements:
1. Static field improvement - Different values and relaxation, diagonal movement is "longer" than horizontal and vertical.
2. Walls have repulsion force (force strength easily customizable)
3. Random order of pedestrain's movement
4. Second type of exit (yellow). Pedestrians have decision process of chosing an exit. Added dynamic field that is calculated once every 20 iterations. It indicates the congestion level of each exit.
